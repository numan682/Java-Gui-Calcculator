## ðŸ›  How It Works

This project uses Java Swing for GUI rendering. Below is a simple breakdown:

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `JFrame` | Main window |
| `JTextField` | Shows input and result |
| `JButton` | Used for digits and operations |
| `GridLayout` | Arranges the calculator buttons in a 4x4 grid |
| `ActionListener` | Detects button clicks and handles logic |

### ðŸ”„ Calculation Logic
- Numbers are stored in two variables: `num1` and `num2`.
- A `mathSign` string holds the selected operation.
- When `=` is clicked, the app calculates and displays the result.
- Pressing `C` resets everything.
